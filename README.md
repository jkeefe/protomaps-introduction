[**A video about the philosophy behind Protomaps**](https://youtu.be/_R5pM8lVldU), by Brandon Liu at the 2023 conference of [NACIS](https://nacis.org/), which is a big, respected conference of mapmakers. His references may be a little technical — because his audience is very technical — but you'll quickly understand where Protomaps fits as an open-source tool in the evolving landscape of online mapping.

This is a more technical version of what we covered in the workshop. Good for a deeper dive.
